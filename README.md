# Space Game Project

This project aims to create a space environment using Arduino and Proteus with various sensors. The game provides an experience where the user controls a spaceship to evade various meteors and space debris. The spaceship can maneuver only to the right and left to avoid these obstacles and can destroy obstacles with sufficient ammunition (weapons).

## Project Features

- A game environment designed in the shape of an 8x16 matrix.
- Random obstacle objects are generated at the bottom of the matrix to simulate the platform moving downward.
- During the game, random characters are generated, including meteors, space debris, reward points, weapons, and invincibility powers.
- The movement of the spaceship is limited to the second row of the matrix, allowing only right and left movement.
- Randomly generated objects move one row down every second, filling the matrix.

## How to Play?

- The spaceship is positioned in the second row of the matrix and can only move right and left.
- Maneuver right and left to evade obstacles.
- Use weapons to destroy obstacles.

## Requirements

- Arduino and Proteus software
- Suitable sensors and circuit components
- Arduino code required for the game to function

## Installation

1. Install Arduino and Proteus software.
2. Connect the required sensors and circuit components.
3. Upload the Arduino code to run the project.
